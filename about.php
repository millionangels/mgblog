    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>A UX professional with a multi-disciplinary background and deep digital roots.</h3>
    <h3>Currently UX Director industrialagency.ca</h3>
    <p>I’m fascinated by how individual the path to UX is for professionals. We start in a myriad of fields: art, design, education, computing science, psychology, writing, business, and more.</p>
    <p>My journey to UX started before “UX” was a word.</p>
    <p>But in retrospect, it was Destiny. </p>
    <h3>Origin story</h3>
    <p>1991: My first week as a receptionist at a medium-sized company, and someone handed me a stack of carbon forms and pointed at a typewriter, and told me how to type a purchase order. I knew in my heart that there was a better way.</p>
    <p>Luckily for me, I had a mentor, the Manager of information services. She handed me a box labelled FileMaker Pro (yes, back in the day when software came in boxes) and gave me the freedom to create a better way. I learned about user interfaces, data validation, logic, databases, and although I didn’t have a word for it then, user experience.</p>
    <p>Since that week with the typewriter, I’ve never looked back.</p>
    <p>I went into information services, where I did everything from crimp ethernet cables to hiring IT guys to building relational databases.</p>
    <p>And then the world wide web happened. And the world never looked back.</p>
    <p>The journey to UX got pretty wild. Like many others, I enjoyed the .com boom, when to know things like sql, php and css, was to be indispensable. Then, like many others, I suffered through the various crashes and recessions that followed, when to know how to design and build websites was still pretty handy, but no longer a guarantee.</p>
    <p>Education? A BA in Communications. A diploma in visual art. </p>
    <p>Me as a bullet list?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve designed a lot of things, programmed a few, and diagrammed a lot of experiences.</li>
      <li>I have a long-standing affection for print, but my feet are in the digital.</li>
      <li>I believe in the creative process. Come up with a great idea, and then sketch a hundred more.</li>
      <li>I’m an evangelist for user story mapping (thank you <a href="http://jpattonassociates.com/">Jeff Patton</a>). It changed to way I work.</li>
      <li>I truly believe that we need to answer the Why before the What and the How (thank you <a href="http://abbytheia.com/">Abby Covert</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PS. Some people know me by my pet project, www.tricksyknitter.com. So if you’re wondering, Hey haven’t I seen you on Ravelry, yes, that’s me!</p>
